# ccowsay

ccowsay is a rewritten version of the traditional cowsay app in C. When I first saw cowsay, I realized it was a good chance to improve my C skills. This code may have bad coding practices. It is not a complete equivalent of cowsay, but it has key features. Maybe I will implement other features too.
